# Privacy Invasive Business Models
When you use a free site like Google or Facebook or watch television, you are the product, not the consumer. Advertisers are the consumers (the ones who pay money for) of these services who they pay to access you. It is in
the financial interest of advertising companies to know as much about their audience as possible in order to
sell more effective (and therefore more valuable) advertisements.

If you want a tool where you are the customer, you're going to have to pay for it. There is just no way around it.
The businesses need to make money and it's either going to be from you or from someone else,a nd if it's from
someone else it's going to be advertising based.
