# WIP: atom schema
atom.xsd comes from https://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/cmis/trunk/SchemaProject/schema/ATOM.xsd

The ATOM RFC appendix B contains a schema written in relax ng compact format. Apparently, someone used some tool
to convert it to an XSD.

xml.xsd was downloaded from https://www.w3.org/2009/01/xml.xsd
